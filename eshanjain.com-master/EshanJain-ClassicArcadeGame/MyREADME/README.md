README: 

Welcome to my game. This program recreates the classic arcade game. The objective of this game is to
avoid being hit by the enemies and reach the river. 

Use your arrow keys to control your hero across the board. Look out of gliding enemies. If you touch
them, you die and restart. Every time you make it to the river, you get 100 points added to your 
score, and you restart. This process continues until you die, marking your high score. 

There is no winning in this game, just who is capable of achieving the highest score. Have fun, 
and watch out for those enemies!

To load the game, simply open the project folder and look for the file named index.html. Double click
this file, and it will open a browser window with the game fully running. Use your arrow keys to control 
your avatar.
